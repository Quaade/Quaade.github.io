			Towards the beginning of 2022 we looked at alternative ways of teaching players how to play Rushrev. The existing tutorial was a very straight forward "Here's the rules of the games and what buttons do what".
			After some rapid whiteboard prototyping we ended up creating a 3 level tutorial that could be completed in roughly 15 minutes, with the goal of teaching the players how to move, as well as how the combat and movement mechanics of Rushrev are intertwined.<br/><br/>
			The first level teaching players basic movement such as running, jumping, and using different attacks for traversal and interacting with the enviroment.<br/>
			The second level was then focused on teaching the spark system, starting out with teaching the players about the Universal Rush mechanic, and then later incoorporating Sparking.<br/>
			The final level then put the player against a CPU controlled enemy in a regular match (though heavily skewed towards the player).
			<br/><br/>
			We weren't too worried about players struggling with the basic movement (Running, jumping, double jumping and air dashing), we really wanted to make sure they left the tutorial with an understanding of how attacks can be strung together with air dashes, as it's the foundation
			of the games combo system. To facilitate that, much of the second level is focused on getting players comfortable with performing an attack and then cancelling it into a dash, ramping up the difficulty along the way until they can comfortably perform the combo multiple times in a row.
			<br/><br/>
			To encourage players to practice and get comfortable, we also added a couple of optional side paths to each level a small collectible at the end.
