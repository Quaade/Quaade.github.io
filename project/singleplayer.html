			Towards the beginning of 2022 we looked at alternative ways of teaching players how to play Rushrev. The existing tutorial was a very straight forward "Here's the rules of the games and what buttons do what", and we wanted something more akin to a tradition platforming experience ready on a tight deadline.
			To speed up the development of the tutorial, we decided to use an old existing system for designing and delivering levels over the internet. This meant we couldn't rely on Unity's build in editor tools, as we needed to be able to both develop them during run time, and serialize them to a format that could easily be shared.
            <br/><br/>
			The single player content tools we had were very barebones and was originally meant to be used for very simple time-trial stages with simple visuals. <br/>
			The complexity of the tutorial levels were way beyond the scope of the previous tooling, and since the tutorial would be the first thing new players saw, we wanted to be able to make more visually interesting levels.
			To that end, i designed a level editor that allowed us to rapidly design and juice up the tutorial, as well as any future single player content we might make.
