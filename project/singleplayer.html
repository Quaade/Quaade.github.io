			Towards the beginning of 2022 we looked at alternative ways of teaching players how to play Rushrev. The existing tutorial was a very straight forward "Here's the rules of the games and what buttons do what", and leadership wanted a something more akin to a tradition platforming experience ready on a tight deadline.
			This presented some unique problems. Not only was our tooling for developing single player content like this extremely primitive, we also had to find out how to teach players how to play a fighting game through a Platforming experience.
            <br/><br/>
			After some rapid whiteboard prototyping we ended up creating a 3 level tutorial that could be completed in roughly 15 minutes.<br/>
			The first level teaching players basic movement such as running, jumping, and using different attacks for traversal and interacting with the enviroment.<br/>
			The second level was then focused on teaching the spark system, starting out with teaching the players about the Universal Rush mechanic, and then later incoorporating Sparking.<br/>
			The final level then put the player against a CPU controlled enemy in a regular match (though heavily skewed towards the player).
            <br/><br/>
			The single player content tools we had were very barebones and was originally meant to be used for very simple time-trial stages with simple visuals. <br/>
			The complexity of the tutorial levels were way beyond the scope of the previous tooling, and since the tutorial would be the first thing new players saw, we wanted to be able to make more visually interesting levels.
