			Rushdown Revolt is a fast paced platform fighter focused on fast movement and flashy combos. I joined the team towards the end of 2020 to work on tutorialization, but quickly graduated to work on anything gameplay related from Combat Design and implementation to VFX work and Lighting.

                        During my time working on Rushdown Revolt, my primary design focus was improving <u>core combat systems and character movesets</u>. My official title was "Unity Engineer and Combat Design", but my prior experience as a solo developer allowed me to assist in a broad range of other areas as well.

                        Rushdown Revolt began its life as a reboot of a failed game called Icons: Combat Arena. The company had acquired all of the assets and IP, but none of the original team who built Icons remained involved in the project.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In a hasty attempt to fix Icons’ design, the early team decided to throw anything they could think of at the wall to see what stuck. Some things did stick, but many things just sort of fell through the cracks, leaving the game with an incohesive design. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        As a designer joining the project, this meant quite a bit of work was needed in order to refine the gameplay experience into something solid. Without a clear vision for where "the fun" comes from, but with an already fairly clear identity of what the game was "supposed to be", we had to figure it out as we went. The result was a fairly unique process of design "in reverse", identifying which parts of the worked in this new context, what needed to be scrapped, and how to unify it all into something cohesive.

                        The glue that holds RushRev together is a mechanic called <u>Spark Cancelling</u>, which allows players to arbitrarily chain attacks into each other. Because Spark Cancelling is so essential to Rush Rev, it warrants a brief explanation here:
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                            Whenever a player lands a hit, they gain a "spark".
                            </li>
                        <li>Players can spend their spark to cancel any move into a short dash, regardless of any other circumstances. </li>
                        <li>That dash can then be cancelled into another attack, which will grant spark if hit, allowing another cancel, and so on as long as the player can keep up the hits.</li></ul>
                        
                        While spark cancelling can be very fun to use and can lead to very exciting and expressive gameplay at a higher level, the system also allows players to bypass many important design and balance levers typically found in fighting games. Without some of those essential concepts to build around, the team had to figure out novel ways to achieve certain desirable gameplay patterns and outcomes that are typically considered somewhat solved problems in the context of fighting game design. Additionally, this mechanic proved to be an especially difficult part of onboarding and player education.
