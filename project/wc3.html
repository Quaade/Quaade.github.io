            Growing up, i spent plenty of nights in a living room crowded with sleeping bags and PC's with my childhood friends, playing Warcraft 3 mods into the morning.
			So I quickly got interested in how to make some of my own, which kicked off my interest in gamedev.
            <br /><br />
			several MOBA's, weird experimental concepts, and at one point trying to force the Warcraft engine to work as a first person shooter.
			At this point i am not quite sure how many different Warcraft maps. Somewhere between 15 and 20. Some of them did gather a small following on Battle.net although i think many of them are lost to time, so you'll just have to take my word for it.
            <br/><br/>
			After getting started with Warcraft maps, i looked into making my own standalone games. My first projects being simple 2D platformers or Shoot-em-up's made in Game Maker.
			I've since then moved on from Game Maker, although it does hold a special place in my heart.
