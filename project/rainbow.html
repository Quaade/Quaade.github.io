            Rushdown Rainbow was our aprils fools releases, concepted, designed and built along with one other designer.

                        In the months leading up to April 2021, a lot of talk was going on amongst the team about releasing a joke update for April Fools on the 1st. After tossing around several ideas, we decided we would “rebalance the whole game” in a very sloppy and nonsensical manner. This would be especially entertaining for invested players, and by intentionally committing to a very low set of standards, we ensured we wouldn’t sink too much dev time into the project.
                        <br />

                An appropriately low-effort logo to set the tone.

During the last week of March, myself and one one other designer went through the entire cast and added ridiculous and extreme properties to every move in the game, making a special effort to convey the appearance of sloppiness and absurdity wherever possible. The end result was a goofy limited-time event featuring wacky physics, characters who could intentionally glitch through terrain, moves that would instantly win the game if they landed, etc. The mode, which we named Rushdown Rainbow, was a hit with our regular players, enough to set expectations for its return the next year.
<br/>We even held an impromptu tournament in which the finals ended up in a complete draw. Maybe this was actually the most balanced version of the game?
