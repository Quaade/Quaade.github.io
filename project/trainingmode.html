            I took the initiative to update our training mode with features that could both assist us with developing and balancing characters, and provide some nice tools for our players to practice the game with.
			The result was a couple of settings that hooked into our AI routines to allow the player to decide what sort of actions the computer would take in any given situation, as well as a toggleable overlay providing useful information about the game state.
            
            <br/><br/>
            
            <div class="foldout">
                <input id="foldout2" class="foldout-toggle" type="checkbox">
                <label for="foldout2" class="foldout-label">
                <span class=foldout-icon></span>Frame Data Preview</label>
                <div class="foldout-content">
                    <div class="foldout-inner">
                        
                        <img class="img-center" src="../img2/trainingframescreen.png" width=80%/>
                        The Frame Data preview would read the game state every update and provide a detailed breakdown about character states over the past couple of seconds, letting players figure out exactly how fast certain attacks were, their damage, and how the game state was affected.
						Such overlays have shown up in a couple of other fighting games since then.
